SNMP_Services
=============

Scripts and configuration to monitor the services of a server with SNMP.

SNMP Objects
------------

This project uses .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3 as prefix for the ID of the SNMP objects.
The up-to-date information about the structure of this prefix can be found at
https://br.binets.fr/OID

* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.1 (integer): Number of problems
* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.1.1 (string): Status line
* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.2 (integer): Number of started services
* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.2.1 (string): List of started services
* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.3 (integer): Number of stopped services which should be started
* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.3.1 (string): List of stopped services which should be started
* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.4 (integer): Number of vital services which are not started
* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.4.1 (string): List of vital services which are not started
* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.5 (integer): Number of services which are manually started
* .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.5.1 (string): List of services which are manually started

Services which "should be started" are services which are registered to be started
when the server starts. On Gentoo, this is managed by the sysinit, boot and default
runlevels.

Vital services are services which are crtical for the server to run properly:
* iptables (firewall)
* postfix (mailer daemon)
* ntpd (time)
* sshd (remote login)
* syslog-ng (logging)
* vixie-cron (scheduled tasks)

check_snmp_services.py
----------------------

This file is a Nagios plugin and shall be installed in the
/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/contrib directory. It takes the same parameters as
check_snmp plugin to establish an SNMP connection to the monitored server.

snmp_gentoo_services.py
-----------------------

This script publishes the output of the "rc-status" command on a Gentoo server
through SNMP objects whose ID are prefixed by .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3.
You may add the following line to your snmpd.conf configuration file:

    pass .1.3.6.1.4.1.34741.3 /usr/bin/snmp_gentoo_services.py
